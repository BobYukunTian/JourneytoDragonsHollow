The Tortoise Chronicles: Journey to Dragon’s Hollow

Background Story:
Trouble is brewing in King Aesop’s peaceful realm. Handsome Prince Harold the Hare has come up with
his most preposterous idea yet. He has decided that, in order to woo the fair Lady Gwendolyn and win her
over, he will be braving theMount of Dooom, on a quest to recover the Emerald of the Isles from the
ferocious Dragon that guards it. He plans to present the Emerald to the fair Lady Gwendolyn in honour
of her birthday. When Prince Harold asks the assembled throngs of citizens for volunteers to escort him
to the Dragon’s lair, he is naturally met with complete silence. He has thus decided to recruit über-geek
Timmy Tortoise, Lady Gwendolyn’s truelove, to accompany him on this hare-brained adventure. Timmy,
not about to be outdone by a Hare, has foolishly agreed to go along. And to think that all Gwendolyn really
wanted for her birthday was a replacement Geek is Beautiful T-shirt.
Of course, Lady Gwendolyn is well aware of the danger involved in this quest. The Emerald is believed
to be hidden in a cave at the far end of Dragon’s Hollow on top of the Mount of Dooom. The Dragon
is known to pace in front of his cave and breathe fire upon and barbecue any intruders. Further, rumour
has it that ever since Timmy Tortoise and Prince Harold attempted their race up the Mount of Dooom
earlier this year, the Dragon has procured some hired muscle to help him protect his loot. Since the Orcs
were already on contract to Middle-earth, the Dragon was forced to hire their smaller cousins the dwarf
Orcs, also known as dorcs, along with their vaguely related and even more vertically challenged kin, the
bear Orcs (borcs) and the pork Orcs (porcs). Aware that the two adventurers are hopelessly outmatched,
Lady Gwendolyn must make sure that they survive their ordeal.
Sadly, Gwendolyn is not a ninja warrior type of heroine. But as an ace programmer in her own right, she
is the brainy type. Before Timmy Tortoise’s arrival in King Aesop’s realm, Gwendolyn was the reigning
five-time undefeated champion of the annual Programming Olympics. But one day, Timmy Tortoise came
plodding into town to enter the competition and tied Gwendolyn for first place and the official title of
Kingdom Geek. Not only was Lady Gwendolyn delighted to finally meet her equal, it was love at first byte.
So to help her misguided friends, Gwendolyn has decided to program a model of Timmy and Harold’s trek
across Dragon’s Hollow, where the cave sheltering the Emerald is located. In executing this randomized
model multiple times to analyze all possible outcome scenarios of the quest, Gwendolyn believes that she
can estimate exactly where and when to send the real ninja warriors that she has hired, so that they can
slay the Dragon and rescue our heroes. Since Timmy Tortoise and Prince Harold have already left on their
quest, packing plenty of carrots and lettuce for sustenance, time is of the essence for the development of
this rescue plan. As a result, Lady Gwendolyn has asked you, Timmy’s close friend and confidant, to help
her with the development of the quest model.
